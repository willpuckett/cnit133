<div id="panel">
Create a webpage that contains the heading, Student Grades, and inputs a student's homework average, mid-term exam score, final exam score, and participation (all those grades will be entered as integers). Create a script that checks for valid input, i.e., that the input is between 0-100 and that, of course, the input are all numbers. If all input is valid then calculate and display the student's final average according to the formula:  

``` 
final average = (.5 \* hwAvg) + (.2 \* midExam) + (.2 \* finalExam) + (.1 \* participation)  
```

Using form text boxes, display the student's final average (rounded to an integer) and final letter grade using the following criteria:   

|||  
|-|-|
|90-100|A|
|80-89|B|
|70-79|C|
|60-69|D|
|0-59|F|

  
If the student's final grade is 'D' or 'F' then display "Student must retake the course". Be sure to check for valid input and do not allow users to input values that will return NaN or any other "weird" result.  An error message should be displayed if the input is invalid and no result should be presented and if all input is valid, the result should be presented as requested and no error message should be shown.
