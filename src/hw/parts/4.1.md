### Part 1: Products and Sums

<p id="flip">Click to show/hide assignment.</p>
<div id="panel">

**Part 1a:** Create a webpage that contains a script, using the for statement, that calculates the product and sum of every fourth integer from 5 to 21 inclusive and then displays the results, along with some accompanying text. (Note: You should print a line that contains the result of 5 \* 9 \* 13 \* 17 \* 21 and a second line that contains the result of 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21).   

**Part 1b:** On the same webpage as Part 1a, create a script, using the while or do while statement, that calculates the product and sum of every third integer from 3 to 21 inclusive an then displays the results, along with some accompanying text. (Note: You should print a line that contains the result of 3 \* 6 \* 9 \* 12 \* 15 \* 18 \* 21 and a second line that contains the result of 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21).  

Use jQuery UI to allow the user to drag an element to a specific area of the page—can be any type of element. For more on jQuery UI draggable see [the example in this page](http://jqueryui.com/draggable/).
